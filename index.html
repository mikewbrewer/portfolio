      <h2>Project 1</h2>

      <p>This project is about stuff, and because it is about stuff, then that makes it about stuff. You might be wondering, what stuff is this stuff about? Well, I can tell you that the stuff that this is about is the stuff that you want to know about.</p>

      <h2>Project 2</h2>

      <p>I bet you're wondering if this project is about other stuff. I'll end the suspense by telling you that the stuff that this stuff is about is different than the stuff from last time. However, contrary to what you might believe, this stuff is actually exactly like the other stuff while still being nothing like it at the same time. Quite the cunundrum, I know.</p>

      <h2>Project 3</h2>

      <p>In conclusion, all of this stuff is about the same stuff but none of if is ever about any of the other stuff. Once you are able to wrap your head around how much stuff that is, you are finanally one step closer to understanding the secret stuff.</p>
